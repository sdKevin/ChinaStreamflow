This document lists the MATLAB scripts used to attribute streamflow changes as described by 'China's nationwide streamflow decline driven by climate and landscape changes'.



(1) 'Main_ISIMIP3aAttributionFramework.m' is the main function of the attribution using ISIMIP3a streamflow reconstructions. 'Plot_ACCNCV.m', 'Plot_CCVLUCCAADR.m', and 'Plot_CCVLUCCAADR_ColorPs.m' are functions called by the main function to plot results within the ISIMIP3a attribution framework.


(2) 'Main_BudykoAttributionFramework.m' is the main function of the attribution using the Budyko method. 'Plot_Budyko_CCVLUCCAADR.m' and 'Plot_Budyko_CCVLUCCAADR_ColorPs.m' are functions called by the main function to plot results within the Budyko attribution framework.
